Aniketh Girish, an S8 student with a research focus in the intersection of Networks, Internet security, and privacy authored a paper titled 'A Longitudinal and Comprehensive Study of the DANE Ecosystem in Email' along with the other collaborators from Seoul National University, Korea, NLNetLabs and University of Twente, Netherlands, Rochester Institute of Technology, USA. This work studies the PKI ecosystem revolving around DANE Infrastructure for email transport was accepted and is to be published in the Proceedings of the USENIX Security Symposium (Security'20), Boston, United States, August 2020. This paper finds DANE deployment is scarce but it is increasing. Moreover, the paper reveals many misconfigurations in the DNSSEC and DANE validation chain making implementations prone to MITM attacks.

USENIX Security is one of the top security conferences in the world, organised by USENIX.
The latter aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, system administrators, system programmers, and others to share and explore the latest advances in the security and privacy of computer systems and networks.
