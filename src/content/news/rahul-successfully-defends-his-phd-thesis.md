Rahul Krishnan Pathinarupothi (2008-2012 batch) currently serving as a Project Associate at the Amrita Center for Wireless Networks & Applications (AmritaWNA), Amritapuri Campus, has successfully defended his research thesis Ph.D. paper on "IoMT Architecture and Algorithms for Smart Health." His immense contributions & efforts in the last 7 years will have a profound impact on improving the healthcare system. He has also contributed towards the wireless ECG system developed at AmritaWNA, called Amrita Spandanam, and has worked on the design, development, and testing of next-generation remote classroom technologies under a funded project from National Knowledge Network (NKN). Lately, he has contributed majorly in developing a data summarization algorithm for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), called RASPRO (Rapid Active Summarization for effective PROgnosis).

Rahul has now completed his Ph.D. in wireless communication systems for healthcare devices under Dr. Venkat Rangan. His research thesis is on IoMT based smart edge system for remote health monitoring which overcomes some major challenges like disease detection and timely severity alerts from voluminous sensor data, and unavailability of the high data bandwidth in global health settings.
