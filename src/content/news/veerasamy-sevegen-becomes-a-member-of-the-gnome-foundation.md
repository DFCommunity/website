Veerasamy Sevagen has been accepted as a member of the GNOME Foundation, one of only 400 members worldwide. He is now eligible for fully funded sponsorship to any of the GNOME Foundation conferences, which happen annually in different parts of the world as well as the ability to apply for any of the Board of Directors position.

GNOME Foundation is an open-source organization that oversees the GNOME Project. The latter consists of a myriad of desktop applications that make up the GNOME Development Environment, which is usually used by numerous Linux based distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Manjaro.
