Veerasamy Sevagen, a B-Tech student pursuing Computer Science Engineering at Amrita School of Engineering, Amritapuri Campus, and part of amFOSS, was accepted as an intern at AquaBASE ltd, a sub-company of BASE Diving Centre Ltd, Mauritius. His role was to set up the company's business and provide visibility to the online world along with the critical duty of setting up digital marketing schemes with the company's marketing team.

BASE Diving Centre is a company focused on offering scuba diving experiences to its customers and also provides professional scuba diving training accredited by PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructor). AquaBASE Ltd was created to fill the gap in the lack of scuba diving equipment in Mauritius, and recently, they have started foreign trading as well. Most of their trade comprises high-quality material from genuine sources such as Cressi, Aqualung, and ScubaPro.
