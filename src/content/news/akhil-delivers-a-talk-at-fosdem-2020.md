FOSDEM or the Free and Open-source Software Developers' European Meeting, is an annual global event organized in Brussels, Belgium to promote the widespread use of free and open-source software. It is meant for people involved in Open Source to meet, share ideas, and collaborate. This year, the event attracted over 8000 open source developers across the world and is often regarded as the best open source conference in Europe. FOSDEM 2020 housed over 50 developer rooms or ‘devrooms’, each hosting topics ranging from popularly used languages like Go, Python, Kotlin and Javascript to topics like Quantum Computing, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies, Game Development, Graphics and so on.
