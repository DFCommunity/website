Proud moment for us as three of our members, Vibhoothi Anand, Yash Khare, and Ashwin Shenoy, got selected for Hack the North Hackathon at the University of Waterloo with a travel funding of 750USD. 

Hack the North is Canada’s biggest hackathon, where 1,500 students of different skill levels come together from around the world to experiment and create unique software or hardware projects from scratch. It empowers and enables the teams to make something great in only 36 hours by providing an abundance of resources like workshops, mentors, sponsors, and hardware components.
