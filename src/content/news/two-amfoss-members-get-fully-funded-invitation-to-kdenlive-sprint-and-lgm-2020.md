Two amFOSS members, Akhil K Gangadharan and Sashmita Raghav have been invited to take part in the Kdenlive Sprint 2020 and for delivering talks at the Libre Graphics Meeting 2020 that is being held in Rennes, France in May 2020. Their trip to the event will be fully funded by the KDE organisation.

Kdenlive is KDEâ€™s Non-Linear Video Editor application. The Kdenlive Sprint is part of the KDE Developer Sprints that are focused gatherings of KDE developers to work on a specific part of KDE. Sprints are an opportunity to plan, design, and hack on the development of an application.

The Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) is an annual international convention for the discussion of free and open-source software used with graphics.
