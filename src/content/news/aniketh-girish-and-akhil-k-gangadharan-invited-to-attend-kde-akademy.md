Aniketh Girish and Akhil K Gangadharan attended Akademy, the annual global summit of KDE which was held at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy from 7th September to 13th September 2019. It was a fully-sponsored visit with both of them speaking at the conference. Aniketh delivered a talk on "Strengthening Code Review Culture" and Akhil had the opportunity to give a brief talk on his Google Summer of Code project with Kdenlive.

Akademy provides all KDE contributors the opportunity to meet in person to foster social bonds, work on concrete technology issues, consider new ideas, and reinforce the innovative, dynamic culture of KDE. Akademy brings together artists, designers, developers, translators, users, writers, sponsors and many other types of KDE contributors to celebrate the achievements of the past year and help determine the direction for the next year. Hands-on sessions offer the opportunity for intense work bringing those plans to reality. The summit included talks, workshops, Birds of a Feather (BoF), training and coding sessions.
